# Natural Gas Price Estimation & Contract Pricing Model

This project aims to develop a natural gas price estimation and contract pricing model. The model utilizes various techniques from data analysis, financial markets, and derivatives pricing to provide accurate predictions and insights into the natural gas market.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following tasks:

### Task 1: Learn about commodities markets and demonstrate data analysis skills

In this task, we explore the fundamentals of commodities markets, focusing specifically on the natural gas market. We demonstrate our data analysis skills by analyzing historical data, identifying trends, and extracting relevant insights.

Technical Terms and Libraries Used:
- Data analysis: Utilizing statistical techniques to extract insights from historical data.

### Task 2: Demonstrate understanding of financial markets and derivatives pricing

Building upon the knowledge gained in Task 1, we delve into the intricacies of financial markets and derivatives pricing. We study various pricing models and techniques used in the natural gas market to accurately price contracts and assess risk.

Technical Terms and Libraries Used:
- Financial markets: The marketplace where buyers and sellers trade financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives.
- Derivatives pricing: The process of determining the fair value of derivatives contracts based on underlying assets.
- Risk assessment: Evaluating the potential risks associated with an investment or decision.

### Task 3: Analyze a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default

Expanding beyond the natural gas market, we apply our skills to analyze a book of loans. By estimating a customer's probability of default, we aim to provide valuable insights for risk assessment and decision-making.

Technical Terms and Libraries Used:
- Risk assessment: Evaluating the potential risks associated with an investment or decision.

### Task 4: Use dynamic programming to convert FICO scores into categorical data to predict defaults

In this task, we leverage dynamic programming techniques to convert FICO scores into categorical data. By doing so, we enhance our ability to predict defaults and make informed decisions based on creditworthiness.

Technical Terms and Libraries Used:
- Dynamic programming: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.
- FICO scores: A credit scoring system used by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of individuals.
